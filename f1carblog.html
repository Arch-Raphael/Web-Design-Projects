            <center><h2>Introduction to F1 Racing</h2></center>
            <p>Formula 1, also known as F1, is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing. It is a thrilling sport that combines extreme speed, precision, and cutting-edge technology. The F1 championship consists of a series of races known as Grands Prix, held on various tracks around the world. The sport has a rich history, and over the years, it has become a symbol of engineering excellence and athletic performance.</p>

            <center><h2>Key Components of an F1 Car</h2></center>
            <p>F1 cars are marvels of engineering, built for speed and precision. Here are some of the key components that make up an F1 car:</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/04/b7/78/04b778ff5815386601e35983cd39570c.jpg" alt="F1 Car Components">
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engine:</strong> The heart of the car, providing immense power to reach speeds of over 200 mph. Modern F1 engines are turbocharged hybrid V6 engines, designed for both power and fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerodynamics:</strong> The design of an F1 car is highly focused on aerodynamics. The car's shape, front and rear wings, and the underfloor all work together to generate downforce, which keeps the car glued to the track, allowing for better handling at high speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Chassis:</strong> The chassis is the structural frame of the car. Made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber, it is designed to be both strong and light, providing the car with optimal performance and safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Tires:</strong> F1 tires are crucial for grip. The type of tire (soft, medium, or hard) can affect the car's performance during a race, and tire management is one of the key strategic elements in F1 racing.</li>
                <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> F1 cars are equipped with carbon-carbon brakes that offer incredible stopping power. These brakes can withstand temperatures of over 1,000°C during a race, allowing drivers to brake late and carry more speed into corners.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="technology">
            <center><h2>The Technology Behind F1 Cars</h2></center>
            <p>F1 technology is at the forefront of automotive innovation. Some of the technologies used in F1 cars include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Power Units:</strong> F1 cars use hybrid power units that combine internal combustion engines with electric motors. This combination provides better fuel efficiency while maintaining high performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Recovery Systems (ERS):</strong> F1 cars use energy recovery systems to capture and store energy that is typically lost during braking. This energy is then used to boost acceleration and improve fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Suspension Systems:</strong> Advanced suspension systems adjust in real-time to improve the car’s handling and aerodynamics during different race conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Telemetry:</strong> F1 teams use telemetry systems to monitor the car's performance in real-time. Engineers receive data on tire pressure, engine temperature, and more, allowing for quick adjustments during a race.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

            <center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>
            <p>Formula 1 is more than just a racing sport; it’s a showcase of cutting-edge engineering, technology, and human skill. The intricate components of an F1 car work together to create the ultimate racing machine, and every race is a testament to the hard work and innovation of the teams and drivers involved. Whether you are a fan of speed, engineering, or strategy, F1 car racing offers something for everyone!</p>
